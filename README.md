abstract data types

stack_inconvenient.c is first try based on linkedlist code.  Works but is not so convenient for user.  
But it does demonstrate a link between the standard linked lists implementations and stack (using linked lists) 
implementations and why they look at first glance a little different.

stack_improved is more user focussed and convenient to use.
